About me
--------

Hi everyone ! My name is Puwanat Sangkhapreecha. However, you all can call me "A" which is my nickname. I was born and grew up in Bangkok, Thailand. After graduating from my high school, I came to the US and stayed in Boston for 4 years for my Bachelor's degrees in Chemical Engineering and Biology. Currently, I am a 3rd-year PhD student in the Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering program. 

I am working in a lab of Dr. H. Benjamin Larman, and my research interest is on developing novel high-throughput method to study protein-protein interactions. My knowledge in statistics is fairly limited. I have used only some statistical methods, such as chi-square, T-test, and p-value. I consider myself a beginner for python and R. My goal is at least to learn how to professionally write codes for statistical analysis and perform well-presented data visualization. 

Fun facts
---------

1. I had an old nickname that my mom gave to me when I was born, and it was "donut." Yes, it sounds very weired, but almost all of Thai people have a nickname, such as Disney or Apple. Our nicknames do not have anything to do with our First and last name ! 

2. I like playing tennis a lot.

3. I like cooking, but I hate cleaning.

4. I am a pretty boring guy XD. 

5. I am pretty friendly. We can go grab some drinks/food to get to know me.

Cool stuff
